DON'T CLICK ON THE SHORTCUTS. YOU WILL TROLL YOURSELF.

What each shortcut does:

[DVD RW Drive - Shortcut] = DVD Drive opens and closes even after restarting
[Pictures] = Reverse shell that runs every 5 minutes
[School] = regular folder
[Writing Assignments] = Replaces\creates google chrome icon on desktop that hibernates the computer when opened

All programs run in the background.

Run the setup file to set up reverse shell, hide the folders, and move 
the setup.bat and readme.txt into the hidden folders. after running the setup 
file, the folders will not be visible (only the "shortcuts" will be).
The only way to get into the folders after they are hidden is by typing 
the directory of the hidden folder into the explorer bar, or, using cmd, 
cd into the current directory then type [other\control\showfolders.bat].
